### Geography

I love in Brighton East, in Melbourne, Australia. Here it is very temperate and very tranquil.

### Reading

I am currently reading two books:

1. *Shoe Dog*, by Phil Knight -- for English class at school.
2. *Elon Musk*, a biography -- to attempt to understand the mind of the magnate.

### Food

My favourite cuisines are:

- Asian
- Greek
- Italian

In terms of favourite dishes, however, it would probably go something like this:

1. Curry with rice.
2. Pasta
3. Souvlaki
